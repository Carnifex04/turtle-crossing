The classic turtle road-crossing game
A python based road-crossing game, in which, the player has to reach the top end of the screen, starting from the bottom, and avoid hitting any of the moving targets, which are meant to be moving cars. With each level crossed, the speed of the moving cars increases.
The game gets over once the player hits the moving car.
